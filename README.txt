Hi there! this is a To do list, made with the PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React and Node js)
There's also a sql file to configure the database by yourself.
I make this project in less than 24 hours and the idea is to show and learn about APIs and how to connect back and front end.
Hope you like it <3
